# Task 3: Writing Basic SELECT Queries


## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench / DB Browser for SQLite

## What I Did
- Retrieved all data using `SELECT *`
- Retrieved specific columns using projection
- Filtered rows using `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, and logical operators
- Sorted results with `ORDER BY`
- Limited output with `LIMIT`
- Explored uniqueness using `DISTINCT`

## Queries Included
- Selection of all or specific columns
- Filtering using conditions
- Range filtering using BETWEEN
- Pattern matching with LIKE
- Sorting and limiting output
- Removing duplicates
